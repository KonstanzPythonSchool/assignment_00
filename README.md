# Assignment 0
This very first assignment is to show you some basics in GitHub and Jupyter Notebook.

## Tasks

1. Replace the following place holders with you information: 

    `## <surname> <name> - <GitHub username>`


2. Open assignment_00.ipynb with in your Jupyter Notebook and follow the instructions there.

3. Commit your changes to the repository with summary "`DONE`". 

## How to commit changes to GitHub

1. **In GitHub Desktop**, under "Current Repository", make sure "assignment-0-*your_username*" is selected. You should see the list of changed files in the left panel, and green highlights for the lines added to each file at the center of the window.
    
2. On the lower left corner of the GitHub Desktop window, there are two fields, "*Summary*" and "*Description*": each time you want to commit changes to a GitHub repository, you need to give a short comment on what you did and what changed. "*Summary*" is the only necessary field, and more times "updated *filename*" is enough... So go ahead and add a summary to your changes!
  
3. Press "Commit to **master**" just under the "*Description*" field (*master* in this case is the *branch* you are working on: unless you want to use multiple branches in your repository, which should not be necessary for the assignments, you will always work on the *master* branch). 

4. You can either:
    - *Add more changes to the files*, and in such case return to point 1.
    - ***Push** you commit(s) to GitHub*. You can do so by pushing the big "**Push origin**" button on the upper right-hand side of the window. 

5. Check on GitHub.com if your repository reflects your changes!
